        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
        flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
        and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
        A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
